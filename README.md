# From Sender to Receiver: Rust's Approach to Local File Transfers

Welcome to the repository for the Rust implementation based on the article *From Sender to Receiver: Rust's Approach to Local File Transfers*. We appreciate you taking the time to explore our work!

## Overview

This repository hosts the source code and various binaries for a file transfer application built in Rust. The application allows for seamless transfer of files locally, providing efficient and reliable functionality.

### Features

- Fast and secure file transfer.
- Cross-platform compatibility with binaries available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Easy integration with other programs through the provided library.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the appropriate binary for your operating system:

- [macOS Binary](https://buymeacoffee.com/otuokofi/e/249247)
- [Windows Binary](https://buymeacoffee.com/otuokofi/e/249262)
- [Linux Binary](https://buymeacoffee.com/otuokofi/e/249264)

Once downloaded, simply execute the binary to start using the application.

## Source Code

You can find the source code for the file transfer application in the [source code directory](https://buymeacoffee.com/otuokofi/e/249272). The source code contains both the binaries and a library, making it easy to integrate with other programs such as Android apps.

Feel free to explore the source code and contribute to the project!
